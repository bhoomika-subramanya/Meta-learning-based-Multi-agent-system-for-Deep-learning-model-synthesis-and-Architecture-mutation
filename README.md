# Design and Implementation of a Meta-Learning Based Multi-Agent System  
### for Deep Learning Model Synthesis and Architecture Mutation  

##  Overview
This project implements a **meta-learning based multi-agent framework** that automates the design, training, and evolution of deep learning architectures.  
Instead of manually engineering neural networks, our system uses **autonomous agents** to generate, mutate, and optimize models for image classification tasks such as **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**.  

The framework demonstrates a step towards **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** by enabling **AI systems to design better AI systems**.
